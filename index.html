                <h1>Did you know that there have been over 380 drone strikes carried out by the US between 2005 and 2013 across the world?</h1>
                <p class="lead"> The United States of America has one of the most powerful militaries in the world. In recent history, one of the most common ways in which the US military projects force across the world and conducts operations is through the utilization of RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) also known as “drones”. Perhaps the most infamous drone model that the United States Air Force operates is the Reaper (formerly known as the Predator). The Reaper has a top speed of around 300mph, is capable of staying airborne for over 24 hours, and can conduct both reconnaissance and strike missions. In the past few years many airstrikes have been carried out by Reaper drones across the world. These strikes often help us complete military objectives and protect our country, often in a quantifiable way. How many buildings are destroyed because of these strikes? What countries are most frequently targeted by these strikes? At times there may be unintended consequences. How many civilians die due to these strikes? How many children? Through the visualization on the following page you can find the answers to these questions and more.

                <p class = "lead"><b><u>How the visualization works:</u></b> You can interact with the map like any normal Google map (click and drag, zoom, etc.). Clicking on a marker for a strike on the map will display additional data and highlight the bar corresponding to the country on the bar graph. Clicking any of the smaller bar graphs will change what data is displayed on the larger graph. Clicking any bar on the bar graph will change the color of strike markers in that country. Use the slider at the bottom of the page to adjust the year range for which data will be displayed on both the graph and the map.
